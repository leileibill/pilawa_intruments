Changes that may break old code
===============================
-In "keithley_2400.py", "readData()" function changed to be consistent with other instruments; now uses fetch instead of read
-In "xantrex_xhr4025.py", class "xhr4025" renamed to "prologix_xhr4025" for consistency (was not originally part of "pilawa_instruments.py", so this is just a heads-up for people switching to the new package format)
