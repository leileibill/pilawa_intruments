Pilawa Instruments
==================
Package format adopted on August 8, 2013.
Document last revision: 1/26/2014


"pilawa_instruments.py" must be kept in the same directory as "pilawa_package" to work correctly.

"pilawa_instruments.py" imports all modules and classes from the package in a concise naming scheme.
Use 'from pilawa_instruments import <class_name>' or 'from pilawa_instruments import *' (unchanged from our traditional syntax).

Before making any changes, remember to check whether you have the newest version. After editing, please update the change log, revision dates of the files changed, and the "pilawa_instruments.py" version number. If adding new files, please remember to update both "__init__.py" of the directory and "pilawa_instruments.py".
